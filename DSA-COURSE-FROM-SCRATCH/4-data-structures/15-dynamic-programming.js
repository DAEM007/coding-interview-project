// ============= DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING =================

// ==== what is dynamic programming? ====

/*
    Dynamic programming is a method of solving a complex problem by breaking it down into 
    a collection of simpler sub-problems, solving each of those sub-problems just once, and 
    storing their solutions.
*/

// === when can we use dynamic programming? ===

/*
    We can use dynamic programming when there are:
    1. optimal sub-structure present.
    2. overlapping sub-problems.
*/

// === overlapping sub-problems ===

/*
    A problem is said to have overlapping sub-problem if it can be broken down into
    sub-problems which are re-used several times. A very good example is the fibonacci 
    sequence.
