// ============= BINARY SEARCH TREES =================

// === what is a  trees? ===

// A tree is a data structure that consist of nodes in a parent-child relationship.

// Note: one difference between list and trees is that: list are linear just as we saw in the linked list
// chapter but trees on the other-hand are non-linear.

// Note: A singly linked list can be a special case of a tree.

// ====== common tree terminologies ======

// Root: A top node in a tree.

// Child: A node directly connected to another node.

// Parent: A converse notion of a child (meaning that, it's same with the child but a reversed case).

// Siblings: A group of nodes with same parent.

// Leaf: A node with no child.

// Edge: connection between one node and another.

// ====== Real-world application of trees =======
