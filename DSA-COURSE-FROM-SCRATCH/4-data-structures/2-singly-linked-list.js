// ============= SINGLY LINKED LIST =================

// === what is a singly linked list? ===
// A linked list is a data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
// Linked list consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to
// another node or null.

// Note: It's different from an array that has elements mapped to a particular index...
// Here, we are dealing with nodes(akin to elements in an array) and we are not mapping to
// any index, rather what we have is like a train of cars(nodes) connected to each other.
